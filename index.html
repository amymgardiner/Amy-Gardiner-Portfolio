          My name is Amy Gardiner and I am currently taking the Washington
          University Coding Boot Camp to become a web developer. I've created
          this portfolio, not only as a class challenge assignment, but also as
          a way to practice my skills and highlight my most recent projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Southern Illinois University
          Edwardsville in May 2013, and majored in speech communication, on the
          public relations track. I also studied theater history literature and
          criticism and business marketing, and received a minor in both.
        </p>

        <p>
          While in school, I was the marketing chair for Student Organization
          for Sustainability for 3 years as well as a student worker for the
          Office of Sustainability where I focused on web content editing and
          data entry. I was also a summer social media intern for the Missouri
          Botanical Gardens.
        </p>

        <p>
          After graduation, I joined AmeriCorps VISTA where I did marketing and
          event planning for the VISTA program as well as the City of Memphis'
          Office of Youth Services. When I moved back to the St. Louis area from
          Memphis, I worked for H&R Block as a marketing coordinator, managing
          the marketing ins and outs of 40 stores within two districts.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that, I started working at Leon Uniform Company in their
          customer care department as their merchandise coordinator. I was lucky
          to work there for four years and gain a great deal of experience
          before moving on.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have since been working as a manager for Kaldi's Coffee. I joined
          their team in February 2020 as an assistant manager at their Kirkwood
          location, and have since been a general manager for their Euclid cafe,
          their WashU Mid Campus Center cafe, and their WashU Farrell location.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work and school, I enjoy watching TV and movies. I have
          three fur babies; two cats and a dog I love to take on walks. I also
          enjoy hiking, bike riding, camping, and kayaking. At times, I consider
          myself crafty as well, and like to cross-stitch and work on DIY
          projects.
