        My name is Amy Gardiner and I am currently taking the Washington
        University Coding Boot Camp to become a web developer. I've created
        this portfolio, not only as a class challenge assignment, but also as
        a way to practice my skills and highlight my most recent projects.
      </p> </br>

      <p class="text">
        I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Southern Illinois University
        Edwardsville in May 2013, and majored in speech communication, on the
        public relations track. I also studied theater history literature and
        criticism and business marketing, and received a minor in both.
      </p> </br>

      <p class="text">
        While in school, I was the marketing chair for Student Organization
        for Sustainability for 3 years as well as a student worker for the
        Office of Sustainability where I focused on web content editing and
        data entry. I was also a summer social media intern for the Missouri
        Botanical Gardens.
      </p> </br>

      <p class="text">
        After graduation, I joined AmeriCorps VISTA where I did marketing and
        event planning for the VISTA program as well as the City of Memphis'
        Office of Youth Services. When I moved back to the St. Louis area from
        Memphis, I worked for H&R Block as a marketing coordinator, managing
        the marketing ins and outs of 40 stores within two districts.
      </p> </br>

      <p class="text">
        After that, I started working at Leon Uniform Company in their
        customer care department as their merchandise coordinator. I was lucky
        to work there for four years and gain a great deal of experience
        before moving on.
      </p> </br>

      <p class="text">
        I have recently been working as a manager for Kaldi's Coffee. I joined
        their team in February 2020 as an assistant manager at their Kirkwood
        location, and have, since September 2020, been a general manager for their Euclid cafe,
        their WashU Mid Campus Center cafe, and their WashU Farrell location.
      </p> </br>

      <p class="text">
        Outside of work and school, I enjoy watching TV and movies. I have
        three fur babies; two cats, and a dog I love to take on walks. I also
        enjoy hiking, bike riding, camping, and kayaking. At times, I consider
        myself crafty as well, and like to cross-stitch and work on DIY
        projects.
