# Amy Gardiner's Portfolio

## About

I have created this portfolio as part of a lesson assignment for the Washington University's Coding Bootcamp course I am currently taking.

This is a way for me to store my recent and best projects to showcase what I've learned in the course and to better market myself for entering the job market as a full-stack web developer once I complete the course.

## Sections

I have divided up my portfolio into a header section with a navagation bar that links to the sub-sections of my page like the "About Me," "Work," and "Contact Me" sections.

I have a banner image with a quote from William Shakespeare, because I've got to rep my theater background!

After that my page shows a section about my education and work history, with a few fun facts about myself and a recent image thrown in.

Then I have my work section with two projects I have completed through class and placeholders for future projects.

Finally, my contact section has functional links to reach me via phone or email, and links to check out my GitHub page as well as two social media accounts I maintain.
