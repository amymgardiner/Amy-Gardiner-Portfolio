# Amy Gardiner's Portfolio

## About

I have created this portfolio as part of a lesson assignment for the Washington University's Coding Bootcamp course I am currently taking.

This is a way for me to store my recent and best projects to showcase what I've learned in the course and to better market myself for entering the job market as a full-stack web developer once I complete the course.

## Sections

I have divided up my portfolio into a header section with a navagation bar that links to the sub-sections of my page like the "About Me," "Work," and "Contact Me" sections.

I have a banner image with a quote from William Shakespeare, because I've got to rep my theater background!

After that my page shows a section about my education and work history, with a few fun facts about myself and a recent image thrown in.

Then I have my work section with multiple projects I have completed through class, at the moment focusing on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Finally, my contact section has functional links to reach me via phone or email, and links to check out my GitHub page as well as two social media accounts I maintain.

## Features

This portfolio is not only a place to let users learn more about me and see projects I've done, but it is also an example of the Advanced CSS coding I've recently learned in class.

Specifically, this page highlights Flexbox CSS styles and media queries to make a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports.

## Conclusion

I am very proud of my work and am excited to have a way to showcase it.

Please take a look yourself and reach out to me if you'd like to connect or have any questions!
